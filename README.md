Setup and Requirements:

Operating System: The lab programs can be implemented on any platform supporting a programming language for computer graphics, such as C++ or Java.
Development Environment: You will need a suitable integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor to write and compile your code. Popular choices include Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

Graphics Library: Depending on the programming language you choose, you may need to install a graphics library or framework. Common libraries include OpenGL, DirectX, or Java's built-in libraries (e.g., JavaFX).

Compiler/Interpreter: Ensure that you have a compatible compiler or interpreter for the programming language you choose. GCC, Clang, or Visual C++ are commonly used for C++, while Java requires the JDK (Java Development Kit).

Instructions:

Clone the repository: Start by cloning the repository containing the lab programs to your local machine.

Navigate to the program directory: Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory of the specific lab program you want to run.
Compile the code: Use the appropriate compiler command to compile the source code file. For example, with C++ and GCC, you can use the command: g++ program_name.cpp -o program_name

Run the program: Execute the compiled program using the command provided by your programming language. For C++, it is usually: ./program_name or program_name.exe. For Java, use: java program_name.

Notes:

It's essential to understand the underlying concepts and algorithms related to computer graphics and visualization before attempting the lab programs.
Each lab program may have specific requirements and instructions mentioned within the program's source code. Read them carefully and make any necessary modifications.
Feel free to explore and experiment with the programs to enhance your understanding of computer graphics.
If you encounter any issues or errors during the execution of the programs, refer to the error messages or consult the lab instructor for assistance.

Enjoy learning computer graphics and visualization through these lab programs! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask the lab instructor for guidance.
